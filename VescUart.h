/*TThis library was created on an Adruinio 2560 with different serial ports to have a better possibility
to debug. The serial ports are define with #define:
#define SERIALIO Serial1  		for the UART port to VESC
#define DEBUGSERIAL Serial		for debuging over USB
So you need here to define the right serial port for your arduino.
If you want to use debug, uncomment DEBUGSERIAL and define a port.*/
